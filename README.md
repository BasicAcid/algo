This is a repo made some time ago for a school exercice, it has no utiliy, except there is an implementation of a genetic algorithm in the /genetic directory.

It is a very slow way to approximate a solution to the TSP problem, it is not optimized at all, and uses recursion, which is very bad in python; but I believe it may be of some interest to someone looking for a toy implementation.

So in fact there are to case of use here: 
  - for fun
  - to stress your cpu!
